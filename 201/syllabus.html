<h2>Course Format</h2>

<p>
You should carefully study the first 6 chapters of the textbook or the same
material from an equivalent introductory book on C++.
During our weekly lab sessions, you will perform activities to improve your understanding
of the material presented in lecture and in the textbook.  I will assign programming problems that
you will complete inside and outside of lab.  There will be 2 exams and a final exam.
</p>

<p>
All required work is detailed in the course schedule, which is published on the Web.  
I will announced in
class or by email changes to required work, points, deadlines and exam dates.
</p>

<p>
I encourage you to collaborate with other students to complete the labs and assignments.
However, you must submit assigned work individually and you are required to understand what
you submit. I will use exams and a final exam to assess your understanding of submitted work
for labs and assignments.
</p>

<h2>Course Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Students will learn how to write programs in the C++ language.</li>
  <li>Students will improve computational thinking skills, 
      which can be used to solve a wide range of problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Learn how to devise algorithms that solve computing problems.</li>
  <li>Learn about primitive data types.</li>
  <li>Learn about user-defined data types.</li>
  <li>Learn about flow control constructs.</li>
  <li>Learn about functions.</li>
  <li>Learn about arrays and vectors.</li>
  <li>Learn how to compile code into executable files.</li>
  <li>Learn how to use the Linux command line interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignments/Labs</h2>

<p>DEADLINE: Lab assignments are due the Friday following the day of the lab.</p>

<p>
In this course, you will complete a sequence of assignments, which I also refer to as labs.
These assignments involve research, programming and problem solving.
You will produce source code for each assignment.
Source code is text that are in files.
For each assingment, you will create a folder inside a Cloud9 workspace
and place the source code files for the assingment in the assignment folder.
The assignments can be completed using a Web browser with an Internet connection.
If you don't own a computer or have an Internet connection,
then you can work in lab computers in JB 359, JB 358 and JB 360.  
</p>

<p>
IMPORTANT: Programs submitted with compilation errors receive no credit.
</p>

<p>
Programs that are incorrect or do not solve the stated problem will lose some or all points.
</p>

<p>
Assignments that are submitted before the deadline are eligible to receive a full score.
Assignments submitted within one week (7 days) after the deadline are eligible
to receive a maximum of 75% of the point value of the assignment.
Assignments submitted more that one week after the deadline will not be accepted.
</p>

<p>
Assignments can only be submitted once.
After you are assigned a score for an assignment, it is final.
Resubmission of assignments are not accepted.
</p>

<p>
You should do the programming assignments on your own 
without copying code from other students or outside sources. 
Presenting the work of others as your own work is called
plagiarism.  If you commit plagiarism,
you will receive no credit for the work.
</p>

<p>
Writing a program to produce required behavior is not good enough for a full score in this class;
you must also write code that is readable by humans.  Program readability is important because
realÂ­world programs are read over and over again in the process of fixing bugs and adding new
functionality.  Program readability will be evaluated according to the following set of criteria.
</p>

</table>

<p class="callout">
* Keep in mind that tabs display differently in different viewing and editing tools. This is a problem if you mix spaces with tabs to achieve indentation. If you use tabs, then make sure that you do not use spaces anywhere in your code to achieve indentation.
</p>
 
<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>
Labs and exams have point values, which are shown on the course
schedule.  Your percentage score will be computed by dividing the total of all points earned by
the total possible points.  The normal scale will be used to assign a letter grade.
</p>
