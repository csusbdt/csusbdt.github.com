<h2>Exercise 1: Tic Tac Toe (60 points)</h2>

<p>
Write a console program that plays Tic Tac Toe with the user.
</p>

<p>
The program displays a 3 by 3 grid, which is initially blank.
When the player takes a turn, an X is added to the grid.
When the computer takes a turn, a O is added to the grid.
Afer each turn, simply print out the grid.
As a result, old states of the grid will scroll up in the console window.
</p>

<p>
After each turn, your code needs to check for a win or a tie.
If either of these conditions are met, then the program
displays the result and terminates.
