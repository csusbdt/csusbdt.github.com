# Cloud9 Setup

## Introduction

In this course, you will create a single Cloud9 workspace named _cse405_ 
and use it for all your assignments.  
The purpose of this assignment is to get started with this process by creating 
an Nodejs Cloud9 workspace and sharing it with me.

## Instructions

1. Create a free [Cloud9](http://c9.io/) account.
2. Create a Cloud9 workspace named __cse405__ using the Nodejs project type.  You will do all your work in this workspace for the remainder of the course.
4. Share your workspace with me, so that I can evaluate your work through out the course.  My Cloud9 id is _csusbdt_.

## Submitting Your Work

Send me an email with a link to your workspace.  Write _cloud9 assignment_ in the subject line of the email.
