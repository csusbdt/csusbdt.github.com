# Git Tutorial

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to learn Git.

## Instructions

Create a free account on Code School and do <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">the TryGit tutorial</a>. Once you have finished it, make your Code School profile page public so I can verify you've completed the work. There is a button near the upper right hand side of the report card page that lets you set your report card to public.

If I can not view your report card, you will not receive credit for this part of the assignment so make sure that you make your report card public.  To check that your report card is public, log out of code school and see if you can view your report card. [Here is my report card](http://www.codeschool.com/users/csusbdt), for example.

After completing the TryGit tutorial, familiarize yourself with
<a href="http://git-scm.com/doc">the documentation for Git</a>
and <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">the Git book</a>.
If you want to thoroughly understand Git, you should carefully read 
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain">Chapter 10 on Git Internals</a>.

## Submitting Your Work

Email me a link to your Code School report card so that I can verify that you completed the Try Git tutorial.
