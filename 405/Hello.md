# Hello

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to start learning about 
<a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, 
which is an execution environment for Javascript 
designed for building network applications such as Web applications.
This course will show you how to build Web applications using Node.js and CouchDB.
</p>

<h2>Assignment folder</h2>

<p>
Create folder named <em>hello</em> in your cse405 Cloud9 worksoace to store the results of your work on this assignment.
When you are finished with this assignment, this folder should contain the following file.
</p>

<ul>
<li>example.js</li>
</ul>

<h2>Install Node.js</h2>

<p>
Install <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> if not already available on your system.
</p>

<p class="csusbdt-callout">
Node.js is installed on the lab computers in JB 358 and 359.
</p>

<p>
When you install Node.js, the Node Package Manager (NPM) 
also gets installed along with it.
NPM is used to install publicly available modules (Node.js libraries).
We will not use NPM in this course.
</p>

<h2>Read</h2>

<p>
Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">Wikipedia's entry on HTTP</a>. 
</p>

> Having a thorough knowledge of HTTP is essential for most software developers and system administrators.

<p>
Become familiar with the <a href="http://nodejs.org/documentation/">Nodejs documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Create and test your first server</h2>

<p>
Read <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/synopsis.html">the Synopsis page</a>
and do the experiment described in it.
</p>

<p>
After running the server program described in the experiment, 
visit the following URL to test: 
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8124/">http://127.0.0.1:8124/</a>.
</p>

<p>
The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a special address that represents the <em>localhost</em>,
which is the computer you are working on.
</p>

> Try using the string <em>localhost</em> in your browser 
as an alternative to 127.0.0.1; this might be easier for you to remember.

Change the message in example.js from <em>Hello World</em> 
to <em>Goodbye World</em> and then test your modifications.

Change the port number from 8124 to 5000 and then test this change.
